# LinkQ

This GitHub repository houses the LinkQ.ir Link Shortener project, which implements a URL shortening service. The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), ensuring a structured and maintainable codebase.

Key Features:

Clean Architecture: The project is structured into three main layers: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): The domain layer encapsulates entities and domain logic, promoting a domain-centric design approach.
ASP.NET Core Web API: Utilizes ASP.NET Core for building the web API, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the service.
Link Shortening: Implements functionality for shortening long URLs to compact, easy-to-share links.
Objective:
The repository is created to facilitate collaboration and code review. Developers are encouraged to contribute to the project, focusing on improving architectural adherence, clean code practices, DDD implementation, and proper usage of abstractions and interfaces.

Contributions:
Contributions to the project are welcome. Developers can submit pull requests for code review, addressing any identified architectural, clean code, DDD, or abstraction/interface-related issues.
